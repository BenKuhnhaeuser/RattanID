# Interpretation tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through interpretation of the identification results retrieved using both the VSEARCH and Skmer pipelines. 

Each pipeline produces two output files:
- the top identification, named `[samplename]_summary.txt`.  
This file includes a column labelled `Data_check` that indicates whether the top identification has sufficient data for accurate identification:
  - `PASS`: sufficient data, enough data for accurate identification  
    VSEARCH: identification supported by at least 35 genes; Skmer: genomic distance not larger than 0.05
  - `WARN`: somewhat insufficient data, identifications need to be treated with caution  
    VSEARCH: identification supported by at least 2 but fewer than 35 genes; Skmer: genomic distance not larger than 0.05
  - `FAIL`: completely insufficient, resulting in most cases in wrong identification  
    VSEARCH: identification supported by only one gene; Skmer: genomic distance to identification is larger than 0.05
  
  **You should treat any identifications that do not pass these data checks with caution.**
 
- a detailed list of all matches of the sample against the reference dataset, named `[samplename]_vsearch.txt` (VSEARCH pipeline) / `[samplename]_distances.txt` (Skmer pipeline). **We recommend to always check these detailed outputs for a comprehensive understanding of the results.** You may encounter three different main scenarios that we discuss below (showing only the top up to 10 identifications):

1. Clear identification, good data
2. Ambiguous identification, good data
3. Ambiguous identification, insufficient data

## 1. Clear identification, good data

### VSEARCH
The top hit is supported by well over 35 genes and thus passes the data check. A clear majority of genes supports one single species.  
In the example here, *Calamus trachycoleus* is identified by 194 genes (51 % of all genes retrieved for the analysed sample), whereas the next best species *Calamus caesius* and *Calamus optimus* are identified by only 47 genes (12 %) and 35 genes (9 %), respectively. Other species are only matched by a negligible number of genes and do not need to be considered.

Reference species | Number of genes | Percentage of genes
--- | --- | ---
Calamus_trachycoleus | 194 | 51.46
Calamus_caesius | 47 | 12.47
Calamus_optimus | 35 | 9.28
Calamus_manan | 10 | 2.65
Calamus_rhomboideus | 7 | 1.86


### Skmer
The top hit has a genomic distance smaller than 0.05 and thus passes the data check. Only few reference species have a genomic distances smaller than the cut-off.     
In the example here, *Calamus trachycoleus* has the smallest genomic distance and is thus considered the main identification. *Calamus caesius* also has a genomic distance smaller than 0.05 and needs to be considered as well. Other reference species have genomic distances larger than 0.05 and do not need to be considered.

Reference species | Genomic distance
--- | ---
Calamus_trachycoleus_Baker_560_BKL020 | 0.0387
Calamus_caesius_Baker_547_JSL044 | 0.0426
Calamus_plicatus_Kuhnh√§user_74_JSL076 | 0.0531
Calamus_didymocarpus_Henderson_4283_JSL037 | 0.0535
Calamus_rhomboideus_Baker_565_RBL084 | 0.0535

### Combined evidence of VSEARCH and Skmer analyses
Both analyses identify the sample as *Calamus trachycoleus*.


## 2. Ambiguous identification, good data

### VSEARCH
The top hit is supported by well over 35 genes and thus passes the data check. The top hits are supported by very similar numbers of genes.  
In the example here, *Calamus applanatus* is identified by 55 genes (15 %), but *Calamus fissilis* and *Calamus eugenei* are close runner-ups with 51 genes (14 %) and 41 gene (11 %), respectively. All three species therefore are plausible identifications. Other reference species are matched by much fewer genes and can thus be disregarded.

Reference species | Number of genes | Percentage of genes
--- | --- | ---
Calamus_applanatus | 55 | 15.71
Calamus_fissilis | 51 | 14.57
Calamus_eugenei | 41 | 11.71
Calamus_mollispinus | 18 | 5.14
Calamus_nuichuaensis | 15 | 4.29

### Skmer
The top hit has a genomic distance smaller than 0.05 and thus passes the data check. Many different reference species have a genomic distance smaller than the cut-off.  
In the example here, *Calamus fissilis* has the smallest genomic distance of 0.0409 but *Calamus eugenei* and *Calamus applanatus* have highly similar genomic distances of 0.0416 and 0.0418, respectively. All three species therefore are plausible identifications. Other reference species have considerably higher genomic distances but are still well below the cut-off value of 0.05. This is plausible as all of these species belong to the *Calamus applanatus* species complex. 

Reference species | Genomic distance
--- | ---
Calamus_fissilis_Henderson_3266_JSL024 | 0.0409
Calamus_eugenei_Henderson_3693_RBL233 | 0.0416
Calamus_applanatus_Henderson_3220_RBL159 | 0.0418
Calamus_mollispinus_Henderson_3667_JSL022 | 0.0442
Calamus_ocreatus_Nguyen_2006_JSL434 | 0.0449

### Combined evidence of VSEARCH and Skmer analyses
At first sight, the outputs of the VSEARCH and Skmer pipelines seem to disagreee as they return *Calamus applanatus* and *Calamus fissilis*, respectively, as main identification. However, closer analyses of the outputs of both methods reveals that *Calamus applanatus*, *Calamus fissilis* and *Calamus eugenei* all need to be considered as a joint identification. This is a highly plausible outcome as all three species are closely related members of the *Calamus applanatus* species group. The ambiguous identification thus results from the biological complexity of the species involved. 


## 3. Ambiguous identification, insufficient data

### VSEARCH
The top hit is supported by fewer than 35 genes and thus does not pass the data check. The top hits are supported by very similar numbers of genes. 
In the example here, only four genes could be retrieved for the analysed samples. *Calamus crassifolius* was identified by two genes (50 %), and *Korthalsia zippelii* and *Calamus peregrinus* by one gene (25 %), respectively. Because there is so little data, these results should be treated with extreme caution. No reliable identification can be made.

Reference species | Number of genes | Percentage of genes
--- | --- | ---
Calamus_crassifolius | 2 | 50
Korthalsia_zippelii | 1 | 25
Calamus_peregrinus | 1 | 25


### Skmer
The top hit has a genomic distance higher than 0.05 and thus does not pass the data check.  
In the example here, the reference species with the smallest genomic distance to the sample is *Calamus burkillianus*. However, the distance is with 0.0989 much higher than the cut-off value of 0.05. For other reference species, it is even higher. These results should therefore be treated with extreme caution. No reliable identification can be made.

Reference species | Genomic distance
--- | ---
Calamus_burkillianus_Dransfield_5066_JSL560 | 0.0989
Calamus_spiculifer_Zieck_NGF_36558_JSL546 | 0.1025
Calamus_oblongus_subsp_elongatus_Dransfield_2064_JSL472 | 0.1026
Calamus_metzianus_Thwaites_3914_JSL440 | 0.1034
Calamus_maturbongsii_Maturbongs_32_BKL180 | 0.1069

### Combined evidence of VSEARCH and Skmer analyses
The VSEARCH and Skmer analyses differ in the identifications provided. These differences do not reflect biological complexity but are caused solely by data deficiency. No reliable identification can be made.

## Useful resources for checking species identifications
In case there is any remaining uncertainty about species identifications, we recommend consulting the excellent revision of the most important rattan genus *Calamus* by Andrew Henderson (2020): https://www.biotaxa.org/Phytotaxa/article/view/phytotaxa.445.1.1. This resource describes all species of *Calamus* in detail, including maps of geographical distribution that can be useful if the provenance of samples is known.
