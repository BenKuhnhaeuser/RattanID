# RattanID

Rattans are spiny climbing palms â€“ their long, flexible stems are the source of rattan cane, which is harvested mainly from the wild. Rattan is the raw material on which a multibillion-dollar trade in cane furniture and other woven articles are built. Out of the ca. 500 species of rattan palms worldwide, numerous are reported to be utilised for cane products.

The RattanID molecular identification toolkit enables the identification of rattan palms and furniture using genomic information. It is based on a comprehensive genomic reference database containing 99% of all rattan species. 

We have developed two approaches for genomic identification of rattans:
- [Skmer pipeline](Skmer_Pipeline): Identification using genome skims
- [VSEARCH pipeline](VSEARCH_Pipeline): Identification using A353 and PhyloPalm target capture data

Reference data needed to run these analyses can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7733000  
- Sequencing adapters
- Kraken database for decontamination
- Skmer reference database
- Target file for retrieving genes
- VSEARCH reference database

This project is based on a collaboration between the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and IKEA. More infos can be found here: https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/projects/sustainable-rattan
